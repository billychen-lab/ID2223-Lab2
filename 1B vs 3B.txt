Q1 Explain what Boolean operators are in a way that elementary school students can understand.
[1B model answer] (time: 4.86s)
Boolean operators are symbols used to represent “Boolean values”. Boolean values are symbols that represent a truth value, for example T (true) and F (false). Boolean operators are symbols used to perform operations between Boolean values, such as T + T, T - T, F + F, F - F. These operators add or subtract Boolean values and produce a Boolean value.

Boolean operators are used to judge whether something is true or false. For example, when you ask “Is the weather good today?”, the answer is “yes” or “no”; that is a Boolean value. Boolean values can be compared using operators to obtain new Boolean values.

Q2 What is the difference between “AND” and “OR” in Boolean operations? Please illustrate with examples from everyday life.
[1B model answer] (time: 3.00s)
AND and OR in Boolean operations are both symbols used to check conditions. In Boolean logic, AND is used to check two conditions: if both are true, the result is true; if both are false, the result is false; if one is true and the other is false, the result is true. OR is used to check a single condition: if the condition is true, the result is true; if the condition is false, the result is false. If one condition is true and the other is false, the result is false.

AND and OR are two basic operations in Boolean logic. Their difference lies in their logical results:

AND: both conditions must be satisfied in order to return “true”.

OR: as long as one condition is satisfied, or both conditions are satisfied, it returns “true”.

Examples from daily life:

1. If you have money (A), you can go to the movies (B). This means you can obtain “true” through the AND operation (A & B).
2. If you have money (…)

Q3 What is the “NOT” operation? Give two examples.
[1B model answer] (time: 5.62s)
The NOT operation is one of the operators. When it operates, it takes the opposite of a value, i.e. 1 -> 0, 0 -> 1.

Example 1:
1 + NOT 2 = 1 + 0 = 1

Example 2:
5 + NOT 3 = 5 + 1 = 6

The NOT operation is most common when there is a value both before and after the operator. It can be used to express the concept of “NOT”.

[3B model answer] (time: 7.65s)
The “NOT” operation is a kind of logical operation used to invert the value of a logical expression. It returns true when the original value is false, and vice versa.

Example 1: x = 5
NOT(x) = !x
= !5
= 0
Example 2: x = 0
NOT(x) = !x
= !0
= 1

Q4 In programming, what does the condition if (x > 3 && x < 10) mean?
[1B model answer] (time: 0.87s)
This condition means that the value of x is between 3 and 10.

[3B model answer] (time: 1.13s)
This sentence means that x is between 3 and 10 (not including 3 and 10).

Q5 In programming, what does the condition if (age < 18 || isStudent) mean?
[1B model answer] (time: 1.07s)
The condition if (age < 18 || isStudent) means that the person is either under 18 years old or has student status.

[3B model answer] (time: 1.38s)
This is a conditional statement that determines whether a person is an adult or a student based on the condition.
